# Rama Krishna Reddy Boggula
My name is Rama Krishna Reddy Boggula.I am Born and brought up in Tiruvuru, Andhra Pradesh.I used to roam around my place and other nearby places ever since i was a kid to know much about the places.I was basically an introvert, so it was obvious that i used to talk less with other people.But everything changed when i joined college in chennai for undergraduation.This college being far from my home town helped me in improving my communication skills while staying away from my parents. I gained confidence talking to my friends while staying among them.[click here to view my picture](MyPicture.jpeg)
