# Soccer
This Game Requires Not only Physical strength But also Mental Strength. This game has many set of rules to test your patience where we need to be focused every time. Within the given limited amount of time of 90 minutes it requires understanding ability to know the gravity of the situation and ability to grab every oppurtunity we get which is more challenging.**I love Soccer**
